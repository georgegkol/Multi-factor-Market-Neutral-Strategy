This report presents a systematic market-neutral, multi-factor investment strategy for New York Stock Exchange equities with the objective of delivering steady returns while minimizing correlation with the market. A robust feature set is integrated combining momentum-based indicators, fundamental factors, and analyst recommendations. Using various statistical tests for feature selection, the strategy identifies key drivers of equity performance and ranks stocks to build a balanced portfolio of long and short positions. Portfolio construction methods, including equally weighted, risk parity, and minimum variance beta-neutral approaches, were evaluated through rigorous backtest- ing. Risk parity demonstrated superior performance with a higher Sharpe ratio, lower beta, and smaller maximum drawdown compared to the S&P 500. Risk parityâ€™s mar- ket neutrality, 
combined with its ability to maintain steady returns and mitigate large drawdowns, makes it a suitable approach for managing significant capital in equity markets.
